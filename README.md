# CLIENTES-WEB

This project implements a simple matrix operations library using JavaScript. The library is encapsulated in the `Matrix` class, which provides various methods for performing operations on matrices.

## Project Structure

```
clientes-web
├── src
│   ├── proyecto_clientes_web.js  # Contains the Matrix class with matrix operations
│   └── index.html                 # Main HTML page for user interaction
└── README.md                      # Documentation for the project
```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The page will prompt you to enter the dimensions of the matrix and the values for each position.
3. You can perform various matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, and more using the provided interface.

## Matrix Operations

The `Matrix` class includes the following methods:

- **Addition**: Adds two matrices.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one matrix from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplies a matrix by a scalar value.
- **Transpose**: Returns the transpose of a matrix.
- **Determinant**: Calculates the determinant of a square matrix.
- **Inverse**: Computes the inverse of a square matrix.
- **Identity**: Generates an identity matrix of a given size.
- **Get User Matrix**: Prompts the user to input matrix values.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of matrix operations for effective use of the library.
